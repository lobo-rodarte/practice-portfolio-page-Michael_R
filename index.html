<!-- 
Step 1: Plan the Portfolio Page 
Before coding, students will plan the structure of their portfolio page. The page should include: 
1. A Header: Contains the name and a brief tagline. 
2. An "About Me" Section: Includes a paragraph about themselves. 
3. A Skills Table: Displays a list of skills or tools with proficiency levels in a table format. 
4. A Contact Form: Allows visitors to send a message, including fields for the visitor's name, email, and message. 
Step 2: Create the HTML Structure 
1. Use semantic tags like <header>, <section>, and <footer> to organize the page. 
2. Create a table with appropriate headers (<th>), rows (<tr>), and cells (<td>). 
3. Add a form with labels, input fields, and a submit button. The form should use: 
○ type="text" for the name field. 
○ type="email" for the email field. 
○ <textarea> for the message field. 
4. Use other relevant tags, such as <h1>, <p>, <ul>, or <img>, to enhance the design.
